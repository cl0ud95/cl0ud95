### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Wei Ern. You can call me Wayne too.

**An aspiring Cloud/DevOps Engineer**

I am currently on a career transition from the construction industry to cloud programming. This is where I will be documenting my DIY projects on the cloud. Currently, all my projects are centered around AWS as the cloud provider.

### Infrastructure as Code

IaC is essentially the process of using code to manage infrastructure on the cloud. Since it has numerous advantages over using the console, I figured that it would be best to put it at the start of my education

Currently, my projects uses Terraform and Packer to deploy and manage infrastructure in AWS.

- Mini Terraform Projects - Small DIY projects I created to learn the basics to Terraform
	1. Creating the terraform remote backend in an S3 bucket
	2. Deploying a simple VPC network
	3. Website hosting with S3 and CloudFront
	4. Serverless API Solution for DynamoDB
	
- Three-tier web application created using EC2 AMIs, ALB, ASG, VPC, VPC Endpoints, S3 and Aurora RDS DB
